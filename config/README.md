# Release Configuration

Aster release artifacts consume one non-secret JSON manifest through Flutter's
`--dart-define-from-file` option. Copy `release.example.json` to an ignored
local file, replace every placeholder, keep keys sorted, and validate it before
building:

```sh
make verify-release-configuration \
  RELEASE_CONFIG=config/release.internal.local.json \
  RELEASE_AUDIENCE=internal-beta
```

Use `public-distribution` only after release ownership has supplied the market
proxy, support, terms, and privacy destinations. The validator accepts no
unknown keys and no credentials, tokens, API keys, mnemonics, passwords, or
other secrets. Compile-time values are recoverable from a mobile binary.

The example deliberately fails validation until all `REPLACE_ME` values are
replaced with deployment-owned values. Local manifests and iOS export options
must never be committed.

The owned iOS export target also validates its ignored ExportOptions plist. It
requires an explicit Apple team, the committed bundle identifier, an export
destination, and `manageAppVersionAndBuildNumber=false`. Public distribution
accepts only an App Store Connect method. Manual signing must name the app's
single provisioning profile; automatic signing must not carry a manual profile
map, and new plist keys require a source-policy review.

`ASTER_USDT_PRECISION` is the asset's canonical decimal precision from `0`
through `18`. Negative, signed, padded, or out-of-range values fail before any
release build starts.
